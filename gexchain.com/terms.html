        <h2>2. RISK WARNING</h2>
        
        <p>2.1. Buying, selling and investing in cryptocurrencies can be risky. The risk of loss in trading or holding cryptocurrency can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading or holding cryptocurrency is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. In considering whether to trade or hold cryptocurrency, you should be aware that the price or value of cryptocurrency can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero.</p>
        
        <p>2.2. The cryptocurrencies market information relating to the past performance of an investment is not necessarily a guide to its performance in the future. The value of investments or income from them may go down as well as up. Like stocks and shares as well, cryptocurrencies are valued from second to second, their bid and offer value fluctuates sometimes widely. The degrees of fluctuation of prices vary significantly and the value of higher volatility funds may change suddenly. The value of investments may rise or fall due to the volatility of world markets, interest rates and capital values or, for investments held in overseas markets, changes in the rate of exchange in the currency in which the investments are denominated. You may not necessarily get back the amount you invested.</p>
        
        <p>2.3. You know and understand cryptocurrency trading also has certain risks which can cause a complete loss to zero. As cryptocurrencies are no official currency and the legal status is still undefined, their legal nature is subject of change under different jurisdictions. Unlike official currencies, which are backed up by governments or other legal entities like the FED, ECB or others, cryptocurrencies are a private currency, generated by all the world. There is no central bank that could take corrective measures to protect the value of the cryptocurrencies at a possible crisis.</p>
        
        <p>2.4. You know and understand cryptocurrency trading could be affected by hackers, change of laws, official restrictions, frauds, technical issues, collapse of infrastructure and many other possible threats.</p>
        
        <p>2.5. All content provided through this website is only for your personal information and use and is not intended to address your particular requirements or to be relied upon in making (or refraining from making) any specific investment or other decision. Such content shall not constitute any form of advice or recommendation by Gexchain. Furthermore, there may be additional risks that Gexchain have not foreseen or named in this Terms of Use.</p>
        
        <p>2.6. Gexchain does not provide any investment advice in connection with the services contemplated by these Terms of Use. We only provide information on the price, range, volatility of cryptocurrencies. Any decisions to buy or sell cryptocurrencies are made on your decision solely. Gexchain will not be liable for any loss you might face.</p>
        
        <p>2.7. If you are unsure about any specific investment or other decision, you should obtain appropriate expert independent advice and assess carefully whether your financial background is suitable for trading cryptocurrencies. Your decisions and investments are subject to your personal responsibility.</p>

To ensure we meet these standards, our customers are required to provide certain personal details and documents when opening a Gexchain Account (“Identity Verification”). The nature and extent of the Identity Verification required will depend upon which of our supported countries you are resident in, and the deposit and withdrawal limits that you wish to apply to your Gexchain Account.

You accept and agree that you will remain subject to such procedures at all times. For identity verification contact our site's online support. You accept and agree that there may be delays in accessing your Gexchain Account, or in carrying out transactions through your Gexchain Account, while we undertake any Identity Verification and/or EDD procedures.

        <p>4.2. To activate your account and start transacting, you should transfer funds to your new account by making a qualifying deposit that should be done by one payment. However, internal exchange transactions are not considered while classifying your account as activate accounts. This deposit is only required for new users as a security measure, you will receive the deposit on your account, and you will be able to withdraw it instantly. This procedure name is wallet-wallet verification, and it means for you that nobody can access your account and make withdrawal without your permission.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>6. TRANSACTIONS</h2>
        
        <p>6.1. Transaction Refusal. We may refuse to enter into a transaction, or we may terminate a particular transaction or all current transactions that you have outstanding with us, without notice to you:<br />if you fail to make any payment or make payment from a blockchain account from which you are doing so unlawfully.<br />if you fail to provide any material information we have requested or any information or warranty that you have given to us is, or becomes in our opinion, materially inaccurate, incorrect or misleading.<br />in the event of your death or loss of mental capacity.<br />if a serious dispute has arisen between us.<br />if the performance of our obligations under this agreement becomes unlawful.<br />if you terminate this agreement in accordance with clause 7 below.<br />You must notify us immediately if you become aware of any event referred to in this paragraph happening or being likely to happen.</p>
        
        <p>6.2. In the event that we refuse a transaction and where it is lawful to do so, we will purchase at the prevailing market rate, the equivalent in your chosen cryptocurrency with the gross value of your deposit less any expenses, premiums, commissions or other fees incurred by us. The balance will then be sent to your Default Address. In the event that we incur a loss on the transaction, you will be liable to pay us the full amount of that loss.</p>
        
        <p>6.3. You acknowledge that under certain rare circumstances, we may be obligated to freeze your account completely and retain any funds that we are holding on your behalf pending further investigation.</p>
        
        <p>6.4. You acknowledge that the amount of any loss realized on the termination of a transaction is a debt payable by you and agree that we may immediately deduct the total amount of any loss (together with any expenses, premiums, commissions or other fees incurred by us) from any funds we are holding for you, including any monies you have paid to us in relation to any transaction. If the amount we are seeking to recover exceeds the amount of any funds held by us on your behalf, you agree to pay the balance within 7 days of being notified of the total amount due.</p>
        
        <p>6.5. We will not pay you any profit arising from the termination of a transaction in any circumstances.</p>
        
        <p>6.6. You agree that we may charge you interest on any sum that remains payable to us after we terminate any or all of your transactions at a rate of 5% per. Interest will accrue and will be calculated daily and be compounded monthly from the date payment was due until the full payment is received by us from you.</p>
        
        <p>6.7. If we refuse or terminate a transaction and where it is lawful to do so, we will send you a written statement explaining the amount of any sums that may be payable to us and the amount of any sums being withheld by us.</p>
        
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h2>7. FEES</h2>
        
        <p>7.1. External fees. Every cryptocurrency transaction must be added to the blockchain, the official public ledger of all completed transactions, in order to be considered a successful and valid transfer. The work of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain is done by miners, which are powerful computers that make up a portion of the network and confirm its transactions. Miners spend vast amounts of computing power and energy doing this for a financial reward: with every block (a collection of transactions) added to the blockchain comes a bounty called a block reward, as well as all fees sent with the transactions that were confirmed and included in the block. For this reason, miners have a financial incentive to prioritize the validation of transactions that include a higher fee. For someone looking to send funds and get a quick confirmation, the appropriate fee to include depends on the cryptocurrency being sent and can vary greatly, depending on a number of factors, such as transaction size and network conditions. Your wallet will automatically calculate the appropriate fee for sending your chosen cryptocurrency. The fee for sending ether is static (you can view the fee for sending ether by clicking “Send” and selecting Ether as the currency), while the fees for sending bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and stellar are dynamic and will be calculated by your wallet after you input the amount you want to send. This article explains bitcoin transaction fees in greater detail.</p>
        
        <p>7.2. Internal fees. The Our Digital Exchange shall enable matching of buy and sell orders between Users. The latest information on the time for settlement of any transactions and the costs and fees associated with transactions shall be as published on our Site from time to time. According to our rules, for each user there is a mandatory commission for all deposits, and for all withdrawals. We trade at a variable percentage above market rate to cover our operating costs and to allow our vendors to make a profit. The trade-off for this is ease of use and the speed of the service - we're not the cheapest, but we try to be the best! Everything depends on the loading of our system and the magnitude of the operation.</p>
        
        <p>7.3. Collection-Related Costs. If you fail to pay fees or any other amounts owed to Payward under these Terms and Payward refers your account(s) to a third party for collection, then Payward will charge you the lesser of an 18% collection fee or the maximum percentage permitted by applicable law, to cover Payward's collection-related costs.</p>
        
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h2>8. SECURITY</h2>

Gexchain shall have no liability to you for or in connection with any unauthorized access to your Gexchain Account, where such unauthorized access was due to no fault of Gexchain, and/or any failure by you to act upon any notice or alert that we send to you.</p>
        
        <p>8.3. The security of your Gexchain Account may be compromised, or interruption caused to it, by phishing, spoofing or other attack, computer viruses, spyware, scareware, Trojan horses, worms or other malware that may affect your computer or other equipment. Gexchain strongly recommends that you regularly use reputable virus screening and prevention software and remain alert to the fact that SMS, email services and search engines are vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks.</p>

        <p>9.1. While we will do everything, we can provide continuous operations, Gexchain does not provide any warranty in relation to the availability of the Gexchain Site or your Gexchain Account. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we do not guarantee continuous access to the Gexchain Site or your Gexchain Account and make no representation that the Gexchain Site, Gexchain API, your Gexchain Account and/or any products or services offered therein will be available without interruption; or that there will be no delays, failures, errors, omissions or loss of transmitted information.</p>

        <h2>10. TRANSACTIONS ON CRYPTOCURRENCY NETWORKS</h2>
        
        <p>10.1. When you use your Gexchain Account to send or receive cryptocurrency, the transaction must be confirmed and recorded in the public ledger associated with the relevant cryptocurrency network (e.g. the Bitcoin network or the Ethereum network). That cryptocurrency network is solely responsible for verifying and confirming any such transactions. Gexchain cannot confirm, cancel or reverse transactions on a cryptocurrency network, other than confirming to you that the network has completed the transaction.</p>
        
        <p>10.2. Once submitted to a cryptocurrency network, a transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the network. A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Funds associated with transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly and will not be included in your Gexchain Wallet balance or be available to you to conduct transactions.<br />When you send cryptocurrency from your Gexchain Account, you are authorizing us to submit your transaction request to the relevant cryptocurrency network. Once a transaction request has been submitted to the relevant cryptocurrency network, the network will automatically complete or reject the request and neither you or Gexchain will be able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction.<br />Cryptocurrency networks are operated by decentralized networks of independent third parties. They are not owned, controlled or operated by Gexchain so we cannot ensure that any transaction details you submit will be confirmed by the relevant cryptocurrency network. You agree that any transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the cryptocurrency network used to process the transaction.</p>
        
        <p>10.3. SITE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE THAT:<br />Gexchain is not responsible for the operation of any cryptocurrency network’s underlying software protocols and makes no guarantee as to their availability, security, or functionality.<br />the underlying software protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (known as “forks”), and that such forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or name of any cryptocurrency you store in your Gexchain Account. Should a fork occur, Gexchain may, with or without notice to you, temporarily suspend our operations and, in our sole discretion, decide whether or not to support either branch of the forked protocol entirely.<br />in the event Gexchain decides not to support a branch of a forked protocol, you will not be given access to the assets on that fork. Those assets will be securely held by Gexchain and we will not buy or sell them.</p>
